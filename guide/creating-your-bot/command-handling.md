# Command handling

Unless your bot project is a small one, it's not a very good idea to have a single file with a giant `if`/`else if` chain for commands. If you want to implement features into your bot and make your development process a lot less painful, you'll want to implement a command handler. Let's get started on that!

Here are the base files and code we'll be using:

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item npm
```sh:no-line-numbers
npm install @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```
:::
::: code-group-item yarn
```sh:no-line-numbers
yarn add @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```
:::
::: code-group-item pnpm
```sh:no-line-numbers
pnpm add @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
```
:::
::::

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item index.js
```js
const { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });

client.once('ready', () => {
	console.log('Ready!');
});

client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;

	const { commandName } = interaction;

	if (commandName === 'ping') {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	} else if (commandName === 'beep') {
		await interaction.reply('Boop!');
	}
});

client.login(token);
```
:::
::: code-group-item deploy-commands.js
```js
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const { Routes } = require('discord-api-types/v9');
const { clientId, guildId, token } = require('./config.json');

const commands = [];

const rest = new REST({ version: '9' }).setToken(token);

rest.put(Routes.applicationGuildCommands(clientId, guildId), { body: commands })
	.then(() => console.log('Successfully registered application commands.'))
	.catch(console.error);
```
:::
::: code-group-item config.json
```json
{
	"clientId": "123456789012345678",
	"guildId": "876543210987654321",
	"token": "your-token-goes-here"
}
```
:::

## Individual command files

Your project directory should look something like this:

```:no-line-numbers
discord-bot/
├── node_modules
├── config.json
├── deploy-commands.js
├── index.js
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

Create a new folder named `commands`, which is where you'll store all of your commands.

We'll be using utility methods from the [`@discordjs/builders`](https://github.com/discordjs/builders) package to build the slash command data, so open your terminal and install it.

:::: code-group
::: code-group-item npm
```sh:no-line-numbers
npm install @discordjs/builders
```
:::
::: code-group-item yarn
```sh:no-line-numbers
yarn add @discordjs/builders
```

:::
::: code-group-item pnpm
```sh:no-line-numbers
pnpm add @discordjs/builders
```
:::
::::

Next, create a `commands/ping.js` file for your ping command:

```js
const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('@discordjs/builders');

module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
		.setName('ping')
		.setDescription('Replies with Pong!'),
	async execute(interaction) {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	},
};
```

You can go ahead and do the same for the rest of your commands, putting their respective blocks of code inside the `execute()` function.

::: tip
[`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports) is how you export data in Node.js so that you can [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id) it in other files.

If you need to access your client instance from inside a command file, you can access it via `interaction.client`. If you need to access external files, packages, etc., you should `require()` them at the top of the file.
:::

## Reading command files

In your `index.js` file, make these additions:

```js {1-2,7}
const fs = require('fs');
const { Client, Collection, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });

client.commands = new Collection();
```

We recommend attaching a `.commands` property to your client instance so that you can access your commands in other files. The rest of the examples in this guide will follow this convention.

::: tip
[`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) is Node's native file system module. <DocsLink section="collection" path="class/Collection" /> is a class that extends JavaScript's native [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) class, and includes more extensive, useful functionality.
:::

This next step is how to dynamically retrieve your command files. The [`fs.readdirSync()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options) method will return an array of all the file names in a directory, e.g. `['ping.js', 'beep.js']`. To ensure only command files get returned, use `Array.filter()` to leave out any non-JavaScript files from the array. With that array, loop over it and dynamically set your commands to the `client.commands` Collection.

```js {2,4-9}
client.commands = new Collection();
const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync('./commands').filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));

for (const file of commandFiles) {
	const command = require(`./commands/${file}`);
	// Set a new item in the Collection
	// With the key as the command name and the value as the exported module
	client.commands.set(command.data.name, command);
}
```

Use the same approach for your `deploy-commands.js` file, but instead `.push()` to the `commands` array with the JSON data for each command.

```js {1,7,9-12}
const fs = require('fs');
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const { Routes } = require('discord-api-types/v9');
const { clientId, guildId, token } = require('./config.json');

const commands = [];
const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync('./commands').filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));

for (const file of commandFiles) {
	const command = require(`./commands/${file}`);
	commands.push(command.data.toJSON());
}
```

## Dynamically executing commands

You can use the `client.commands` Collection setup to retrieve and execute your commands! Inside the `interactionCreate` event, delete the `if`/`else if` chain of commands and replace it with this:

```js {4-13}
client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
	if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;

	const command = client.commands.get(interaction.commandName);

	if (!command) return;

	try {
		await command.execute(interaction);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
		await interaction.reply({ content: 'There was an error while executing this command!', ephemeral: true });
	}
});
```

First, fetch the command in the Collection with that name and assign it to the variable `command`. If the command doesn't exist, it will return `undefined`, so exit early with `return`. If it does exist, call the command's `.execute()` method, and pass in the `interaction` variable as its argument. In case something goes wrong, log the error and report back to the member to let them know.

And that's it! Whenever you want to add a new command, make a new file in your `commands` directory, name it the same as the slash command, and then do what you did for the other commands. Remember to run `node deploy-commands.js` to register your commands!
